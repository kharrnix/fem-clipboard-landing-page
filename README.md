# Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Clipboard landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9). Took around three or four days to complete, I started rushing a bit towards the end since I wanted to move on to other projects.
